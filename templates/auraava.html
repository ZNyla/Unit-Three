        <h2>All About the Aura Reader</h2>
        <p>This is my iconic queen and the reason I started watching big brother in the first place. She has this free spirt that canâ€™t be contained by anyone in that house which attracted her to me as a view. She reminds me of me and I love how unapologetic her in every asset in the show! She has amazing energy that she use to help shift up the house no matter what direction she goes through.</p>
